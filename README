Slice Renderer by Kevin Jacobs

This is a simple slice rendering program. It can draw single slices, multiple axis-aligned slices, and view-aligned slices. Currently the only source of data the program is compatible with is the CTHead data found at: http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/voldata

System Requirements:

    Tested on Ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04
    Graphics card with OpenGL and 3D texture support
    QT SDK
    GLUT
